**TeacherCentral Admin System - Quick Tips for Teachers**

**Note:** This covers basic tasks. Refer to official training materials or contact the Admin Office for complex procedures.

**1. Logging In:**
*   Go to: [e.g., teachercentral.schoolname.edu]
*   Username/Password: Provided by the Administration/IT Department. Usually your standard school login.
*   Contact [e.g., Admin Office / IT Help Desk] if you have login issues.

**2. Taking Daily Attendance:**
*   Log in and navigate to the "Attendance" section or find the attendance link on your dashboard/homepage.
*   Select the correct Class/Period and Date.
*   A list of students will appear.
*   Mark each student as "Present", "Absent", or "Tardy" using the provided options (buttons, dropdowns).
*   Ensure you click "Submit" or "Save Attendance" for the period *before* the deadline ([e.g., within the first 15 minutes of class]).
*   To correct a mistake made *today*, you might be able to re-submit. For previous days, contact the [e.g., Attendance Office].

**3. Submitting Final Term Grades:**
*   Navigate to the "Grade Submission" or "Report Cards" section.
*   Select the correct Term (e.g., "Term 1 Final") and the Class.
*   A roster will appear with columns for the final grade (e.g., Letter Grade or Percentage) and potentially comments.
*   Enter the final calculated grade for each student accurately. *Double-check your calculations before entering.*
*   Add comments if required/allowed, following school guidelines (use comment codes or brief, objective statements).
*   Look for a "Verify" or "Review" step if available.
*   Click "Submit Final Grades". Be aware of the strict submission deadlines announced by the Administration. Once submitted, changes usually require administrative intervention.

**4. Viewing Student Information (Basic):**
*   Navigate to a "Student Search" or "Class Roster" section.
*   Select your class or search for a specific student by name or ID.
*   Clicking on a student's name usually brings up a profile page.
*   You can typically view basic contact information, attendance summary, and sometimes previous grades (access levels vary).
