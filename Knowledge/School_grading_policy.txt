## Grading Scale

*   **Grade: D**
    *   Description: Needs Improvement
    *   Score Range: 60-69

    *   Description: Failing
    *   Score Range: Below 60
    *   Criteria: Demonstrates major gaps in understanding or skills. Required work is often missing or unacceptable. Does not meet minimum requirements.

## Component Weights (General Guideline - May vary slightly by course/teacher)
*   Homework / Practice Assignments: 25%
*   Class Participation / Engagement: 15%
*   Quizzes & Tests: 40%
*   Projects / Performance Tasks: 20%
    *   *Note: Specific course syllabi will detail exact weightings.*

## Behavior Policy Integration

*   **Repeated Class Disruption:** Persistent disruption may negatively impact the 'Class Participation / Engagement' component score, after appropriate warnings and interventions have been attempted.
*   **Missed Homework:** Directly affects the 'Homework / Practice Assignments' score. Repeated failure to submit homework may require parent/guardian contact and academic support interventions.
*   **Cheating or Plagiarism:** Results in zero credit for the specific assignment or assessment. Further disciplinary action will be taken according to the school's Academic Honesty Policy.

## Attendance Impact

*   **Excused Absences:** Students are generally not penalized academically for excused absences (e.g., illness with documentation) and are responsible for completing missed work within a reasonable timeframe agreed upon with the teacher.
*   **Unexcused Absences:** May affect the 'Class Participation / Engagement' grade if participation was expected. Chronic unexcused absences will trigger attendance interventions according to school policy.

## Notes for Teachers
*   Maintain clear, accurate, and up-to-date records of student performance for each assessment component in the official gradebook system (e.g., TeacherCentral).
*   Review and update grades regularly, providing feedback to students (e.g., via EduPortal LMS or in-class).
*   Communicate with parents/guardians proactively, especially when a student's performance drops significantly or there are concerns about academic progress. Refer to the Parent Communication Policy.
